# Disabled Modules

These are modules I deprecated. Mostly they're just expensive APIs or do not give particularly good results.
I wanted to keep them around so anyone can just plug them in to Randal if they ever wanted to.

Also in the future I might make Randal modular - in which case I want to keep this as example modules.
